Mathilukal is not just a love story, but also a social commentary on the oppressive and unjust system of colonial rule. Basheer portrays the prison as a microcosm of the society, where the inmates are subjected to violence, corruption, discrimination, and humiliation by the authorities. He also exposes the hypocrisy and cruelty of the religious leaders, who exploit the prisoners' faith and manipulate them for their own interests. Basheer challenges the rigid and orthodox norms of morality and religion, and advocates for a humanistic and compassionate approach to life.
 
Mathilukal is also a novel of hope and resilience, as Basheer and Narayani find solace and joy in each other's company. They create their own world of imagination and fantasy, where they can escape from the harsh realities of their situation. They dream of a future where they can be together in freedom and happiness. They also share their thoughts and feelings about various topics, such as literature, politics, culture, and history. They enrich each other's minds and hearts with their knowledge and wisdom.
 
Mathilukal is a novel that celebrates the power of love over hate, the power of words over silence, and the power of humanity over tyranny. It is a novel that inspires us to overcome our barriers and limitations, and to connect with others on a deeper level. It is a novel that reminds us of the value of life and the dignity of every individual.
